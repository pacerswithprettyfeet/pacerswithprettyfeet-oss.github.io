Oct 18-22, 1992. Ravi Shastri bowled 17 overs in an innings against Zimbabwe — not surprising, given that Shastri has donned 
the all-rounder role many times before for India. But, this time was different — he was the sixth bowler. Zimbabwe brought 
the entire game to a halt — scoring 456 runs in a massive 212 overs. The agony of witnessing that stalemate far outweighed 
any sincere attempts of goodwill toward Zimbabwe for securing the draw against India. But crucially, those 17 overs that 
Shastri bowled as the sixth bowler were important overs that Kapil Dev or Manoj Prabhakar did not bowl.\

Thirty three years after the humongous halt at Harare, Gambhir decided India needed six bowling options going into the test 
series against South Africa. It has not been a long time since a sixth bowler created a lot of furore — but that was Travis 
Head for his “finger on ice” celebration vs India at the MCG. But the Gambhir gambit — sacrificing a batter to shoehorn a 
bowling all-rounder — caused a lot more noise than Head’s pantomime. The optics on how the test played out did not help 
either. Sundar bowled a solitary over in the two innings combined in Kolkata. But that was a pitch that spun like Sri 
Lanka and bounced like South Africa. We investigate whether the Gambhir gambit would hold water on a more normal deck. 
Specifically, we look at the workloads on bowlers to determine whether a sixth frontline bowling option will be at all 
useful, or did India just carry a very limited batter who does not bowl much? \

\textbf{An era of decreasing bowler workloads}

The average workload on bowlers has decreased substantially in recent times, all across the world and even more 
drastically in India. We look at data spanning three eras — the reverse swing era between 1980 and 2000, the great 
batting era between 2000 and 2015 and the batting hellhole since 2015 (caused by India spiking pitches at home and 
the wobble ball destroying batters everywhere else). Cumulatively, a typical test innings in India has lasted over 91 
overs across the three eras. The great batting era particularly took its toll on bowlers — it took 98 overs on average 
for an innings to complete, well over the global average of 90 overs. The fortunes of Indian batters and bowlers would 
turn on its head from 2015 onwards. From being a batting paradise, a typical innings in India would last a tad below 80 
overs — 2 overs fewer than the global average. It only became worse over the last five years — since 2020, the average 
innings has lasted 73 overs, a full 6 overs fewer than the global averages in this period. The disparities in the strengths 
of the Indian side and the touring units are well reflected in the average length of their respective innings: Indians have 
bowled 73 overs an innings since 2015, compared to a gory 88 overs by visitors. The length of the third and fourth innings 
of an Indian home game since 2020 has been a mere 57 overs. While the birth of the new era pooped all over Kohli’s hope of 
finishing with a 50+ average in test cricket, it also meant shorter stints under the baking sun for bowlers before they can 
put their feet up and sip on cool Gatorade (cigars and champagne if they played for Bazball England).
